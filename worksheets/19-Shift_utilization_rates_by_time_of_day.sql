-- KPI: Shift Utilization Rates by Time of Day (Morning, Afternoon, Night)

-- Not feasible â€“ The dataset does not contain any shift-level information 
-- or timestamps that distinguish nurse hours by time of day. All staffing 
-- data is aggregated at the daily level, so no breakdown by morning, 
-- afternoon, or night shifts is possible.
